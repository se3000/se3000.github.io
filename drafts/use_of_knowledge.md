Software Defined Networking:
This course introduces software defined networking, an emerging paradigm in computer networking that allows a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of an entire network.  

Separating a network's control logic from the underlying physical routers and switches that forward traffic allows network operators to write high-level control programs that specify the behavior of an entire network, in contrast to conventional networks, whereby network operators must codify functionality in terms of low-level device configuration.  

Logically centralized network control makes it possible for operators to specify more complex tasks that involve integrating many disjoint network functions (e.g., security, resource control, prioritization) into a single control framework, allowing network operators to create more sophisticated policies, and making network configurations easier to configure, manage, troubleshoot, and debug.

["Dumb pipes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumb_pipe) is a sort of a high-level tech idea that I've heard referring to the idea of decentralization on an infrastructure level. The gist is that in the age of telephone operators, it was the job of the people sitting in the middle to make decisions. Eventually instead of asking the operator in the middle for someone, you could dial a number. The control was pushed to the edges, and the need for people sitting in the middle was decreased. Similarly information used to be spread in mass by tradtional media companies, like newspapers and television stations. When the Internet came along, the decision of who decides what is news was pushed out to the edges instead of central parties. The idea is that the system has far more possibilities because a single actor can bring new value to the system instead of waiting for the central connector to introduce it. By lowering the cost of change a more flexible system emerges.
