Understanding the taxonomy of encryption workarounds puts them in context, revealing the tradeoffs among them and the new investigatory dynamic they create. Four lessons emerge. First, encryption workarounds are inherently probabilistic. None works every time, and none can be categorically ruled out every time. Second, the different resources required for different workarounds will have significant distributional effects on law enforcement. Third, the scope of legal authority to compel third-party assistance will be a continuing difficult challenge. And fourth, the law regarding encryption workarounds remains uncertain and underdeveloped.  These observations in turn suggest two broad conclusions about the new criminal investigative environment caused by widespread use of encryption. First, it is too early to tell how much the widespread use of encryption will impact the government’s ability to solve criminal cases.  FBI Director James Comey has expressed fears that the government is “going dark” because encryption blocks access to communications. 10 Critics have argued that these fears are overblown.11 Which side is right depends in part on the success of workarounds. The law and technological feasibility of many workarounds is presently unsettled, and empirical evidence about their use remains largely unknown

We classify six kinds of workarounds, which we label as follows: find the key, guess the key, compel the key, exploit a flaw in the encryption software, access plaintext while the device is in use, and locate another plaintext copy.

Modern encryption algorithms follow Kerckhoff’s Principle, first stated by the Dutch cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoff in the 1800s: an encryption algorithm should be secure if everything is known about it except the key.

Today, 64-bit keys can be brute-forced with a reasonable amount of computing power, and 80-bit keys can be brute-forced by large national-intelligence agencies.

For users, this means that the passcodes and passwords they use to encrypt or decrypt their files are technically not encryption keys but functionally act as encryption keys. Consider the four-digit code that may be needed to unlock a smartphone. The code is not the key. Instead, entering the passcode decrypts the key, enabling the key to be processed and unlock the phone. The two-stage process is invisible to the casual user. To most users, passcodes and passwords serve the function of keys.
