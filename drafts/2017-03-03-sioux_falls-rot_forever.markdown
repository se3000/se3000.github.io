A mess is much more telling than a well organized presentation. It is a counterintuitive idea, as simplicity is often held up as a quality that makes things more digestible, easier to grok. The problem is that "easier to understand" does not equal "more accurate." While a simple explanation may be more immediately satisying, it often glosses over many important aspects. Any creative can tell you that making something simple is anything but simple; simplicity comes at the cost of accuracy and control. Honing something down to an easily digestible piece takes curation, cutting away of pieces that tell part of the story. There is a truth in messes, a sincerity of slop, that tells the raw truth like a clean narrative never could.

While it may seem 


Great truths are not revealed by simple one liners and banal platitudes, but through real experience.

It is often believed that the simplest explanation is the easiest one; see Ocram's Razor.

While simple explanations may be better at explaining things. They are also temptingly simple to believe, so much so that they can be used to mislead.

The world is not always a simple place. Anyone that has spent time trying to hone something down for simplicity's sake knows that a lot of work has to go into cutting out and curating.

It is in curating that the most revealing truths are removed. The full bytes are cut down to the tiniest bits of information.

Once enough is cut away, it's hard to tell what is true and what is a misleading remnant of the truth.

A big mess is much more revealing, much more convincing than a simple story.

Don't messes make it easier to hide things? Maybe initially, but it's much harder to cover up the details of a mess. The more details, the more likely a non-corroborating fact is to emerge.

This is why my favorite art is often messy, sloppy in conveyance. The ideas expressed are pure, and the contradictions if they exist are there for you to see and judge for yourself. Diving into a good story with lots of detail is much more engaging than being spoonfed the curated version. The engagement is warm and welcoming, like a world to live in an understand, rather than one kept at arms length to be gacefully presented by someone else.


Organization vs Mess

I am large I contain multitudes

Not many people defend messes.

The best way to judge someone is under pressure.
