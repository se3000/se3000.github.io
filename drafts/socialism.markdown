In my last post, I may have come off as particularly Libertarian. In fact I am not.

Like many in the tech world, I occupy a place that seems to at what seems to me to be one of the polar opposite of moderate position. As far as I can see it, there is an emerging space where the far left wraps around and overlaps with the far right... where Libertarianism shakes hands with socialism. While I don't know what this is called, I believe it is a growing political area, one commonly occupied by tech people. Most specifically, I believe this iddea is represented by the push for a basic income. While it infringes on working people's incomes by raising the tax rate, it also respects the freedom often sought after by Libertarianism. I've become comfortable with this idea based on the fact that while I do believe the world could be more efficient with a laisez-faire government, I also believe that such a system would drastically benefit a fortunate few, and would fail the unfortunate many who were expecting their government to protect them.
