I'm neither a trained economist nor an expert in the field of user experience. Still, I recently found myself contemplating the similarities between the fields. Now economics is a broad field, so when I say this I'm talking less about the field of study and more about the incentives designed by everyone from government economic planners to grocery stores. In an attempt to get people to act a certain way, they design financial incentives that make certain behaviors favourable. Similarly, UX designers try to guide users through certain actions, while giving the user the freedom to make their own decisions. Both aim to funnel you down a happy path, be it with tax incentives or big buttons, but they allow you the freedom to make your own choices.

I recognize that the connection is pretty loose. Both fields are vaguely defined, and maybe it's possible to define any field in economic terms. I have a hunch that the connection goes deeper than surface level similarities, specifically I imagine a lot of UX is derived from behavioral economics. I consider myself relatively amateur in both fields, so the connection is something I'm hoping to clarify or disprove as I continue to explore both fields.

Based on Nick Szabo's [strong reccomendation](https://twitter.com/nickszabo4/status/697295612685979649), I read Friedrich Hayek's essay ["The Use of Knowledge in Society"](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html) this weekend. I reccomend reading it if you're interested in economics. The essay concerns the role of central economic planners in society. Hayek argues that a well informed central planner is only really theoretically possible. To accurately predict actions you have to know what people value, which varies across a myriad of factors(person, time, price, availability...). This information is generally averaged out to create a preferences preferred by no one. Think of it like averaging 100 people's favorite color: brown will leave very few people happy.

So instead of averaging, a well informed central planner would need to be updated about everyone's preferences all the time. When the essay was written in 1945, that concept seemed impossible, less so today. Trusting the NSA when they say this isn't their goal, imagining a future where enough information is gathered about us to know all our preferences seems like it's already in the works. But remember, the goal is to do this to efficiently balance the economy for everyone. Skipping the ineffciency of piping all that data back and forth from a single central repository, the problem of crunching the data is still a tremendous one. Each change in circumstance would trigger massive recalcuations, rebalancing interconnected preferences, which in turn trigger more recalculating... potentially rebalancing endlessly. Additionally Hayek stresses that economics arise from change, meaning that increasing the changes and recalculations required across the system is just asking for trouble. All this, and the idea of a omniscient planner is only hypothetically possible.

So what's a central economic planner to do? Pollish up the résumé according to Hayek. If the problem of preference is a relative one, why not leave the decisions up to the actors themselves? Preferences do not need to be communicated to others, people can make their own informed decisions about the preferences available to them at the time. Balancing of resources will happen naturally due to basic economic forces like supply and demand. The balancing may happen slower than in the hypothetical "omniscient planner" scenario, but it will naturally happen.

Hayek ends up reinforcing the idea that free markets and competioin are efficient, probably not a surprise to many. What I imagine does come as a surprise to many is that decentralization doesn't lead to anarchy, but a more efficient system instead. I've seen the argument for efficiency of distributed systems made in the engineering world, but never such a clear economic argument. ["Dumb pipes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumb_pipe) is a business-speak type idea that I've heard refering to this idea, specifically to the Internet. The idea is that in the age of telephone operators, it was the job of the people sitting in the middle to make decisions. When the Internet came along, that decision making was pushed out to the nodes instead of the connections. The idea is that the system has far more possibilities because a single actor can bring new capabilites to the system instead of waiting for the central connector to introduce upgrades. By lowering the cost of change a more flexible system emerges.

No matter how many times I rediscover it, the idea that "less is more" always surprises me. Be it in engineering, design, or economics, simplicity wins out. The first paper I've read since drawing my new parallel between UX and economics, and I find myself reinforcing the my belief that these fields stem from the same root. I've heard that the best design "gets out of the way," apparently so does the best economic policy as well.
