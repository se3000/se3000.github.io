This month I added support for Ethereum's [Secret Storage Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Web3-Secret-Storage-Definition) to my [eth gem](https://github.com/se3000/ruby-eth). I'd gotten a few requests for it, and I needed something small as I'm in the middle of working through upping my Golang game for later projects. Not much more to report, progress on the Oracle Kit is also being made. Hopefully more on that soon. Happy April!
